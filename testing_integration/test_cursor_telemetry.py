Real Integration Tests for Cursor Telemetry

Invokes the Cursor Agent CLI with -p (print mode) and -f (force) flags
and verifies telemetry events are captured in the database.

EXPECTED TO FAIL: cursor-agent CLI vs Cursor IDE Storage
=========================================================
This test is expected to fail because cursor-agent CLI and Cursor IDE
use different storage locations:

- Cursor IDE writes to:
    ~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/.../state.vscdb
    (This is what our database monitor watches - WORKS)

- cursor-agent CLI writes to:
    ~/.cursor/chats/{hash}/{uuid}/store.db
    (This is NOT monitored - test will fail)

To make this test pass, we would need to add a monitor for:
    ~/.cursor/chats/*/store.db

The Cursor IDE telemetry capture works correctly. Only the CLI is not captured.

Usage:
    python testing_integration/test_cursor_telemetry.py
